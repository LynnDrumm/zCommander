usage: `/z.commander` or right click in any mIRC window and select `zCommander` from the popup menu. A dialog window will show up that hopefully explains itself. You can browse for, copy, move, and delete files and directories like any file manager. In addition there's a "Run" button to execute windows commands, as well as a button to directly load scripts in mIRC itself.

Originally written in around 2008(?) as a personal challenge, as I had replaced explorer.exe as my login shell with mIRC.exe. still seems to work, but not tested for actual file operations beyond browsing directories. Code has been left as-is, with only some formatting updates done for readability.

I don't know how broken this is. I'm not responsible if it eats your files or gives your dog body dysmorphia.
